# The replication crisis

.pull-left-wide2[
## What the crisis is about
- The fact that many scientific findings are difficult or impossible to reproduce.
- Reproducibility is a cornerstone of science as an enterprise of knowledge generation. This is bad.

## Factors fueling the replication crisis
- Wrong incentives in science leading to questionable research practices (see next slides)
- Limited data sharing and transparency
- Insufficient methodological training

<i>"[i]t appears that some authors choose the mode of reporting their results in an arbitrary way. Moreover, they often end up doing it in such a way that makes their findings seem more statistically significant than they really are (which is well known to improve the chances for publication). Specifically, they frequently report p values “just above” significance thresholds directly, whereas other values are reported by means of inequalities (e.g. “p&lt;.1”), they round the p values down more eagerly than up and appear to choose between the significance thresholds and between one- and two-sided tests only after seeing the data. Further, about 9.2% of reported p values are inconsistent with their underlying statistics (e.g. F or t) and it appears that there are “too many” “just significant” values."</i>

# A framework for improving reproducibility

.pull-left[
## Targets for reform (Munafò et al. 2017)

- **Methods.** Better training, collaboration, protecting against cognitive biases
- **Reporting & dissemination.** Promoting pre-registration, improving quality of reporting
- **Reproducibility.** Share data, code, and materials whenever possible
- **Evaluation.** Diversify peer review, preprints, pre-and post-publication
- **Incentives.** Reward openness and reproducibility, not only positive findings

# Preregistration

.pull-left-wide[
## Basic idea

- You write down hypotheses and analysis plans in advance.
- You time-stamp and register them in a public or private registry.
- You commit to the primary analysis before seeing the results.
- You clearly separate confirmatory from exploratory work.

## Why it potentially helps

- It constrains analytic flexibility and p-hacking.
- It reduces HARKing by fixing hypotheses in advance.
- It clarifies what counts as a decisive test.
- It increases credibility for both positive and null findings.
- Kaplan et al. (right plot): <i>"17 of 30 studies (57%) published prior to 2000 showed a significant benefit of intervention on the primary outcome in comparison to only 2 among the 25 (8%) trials published after 2000."</i>

# Preregistration developments

.pull-left[
## Developments (Nosek et al. 2018)

- Rapid growth of preregistered studies across disciplines.
- Emergence of standardized templates and registries.
- Registered reports integrate preregistration into peer review.
- Journals accept papers based on design, not results.

## Remaining challenges

- Bad preregistrations can be vague or incomplete.
- Not all projects are suitable for rigid preregistration.
- Distinguishing exploratory work remains important.
- Incentives for high-quality preregistration are still evolving.

## Communicating the entire workflow

- Any decision - from conceptualizing measures to formatting tables - is meaningful for your output.
  - Tiny mistakes can have massive technical consequences (→ debugging).
  - Various decisions can have ethical implications (→ next session).
  - For others to follow (and potentially invalidate) your analyses, all the details are important.
- What makes the scientific endeavor unique is that it has self-correcting mechanisms. 
- But in order for them to work effectively, you have to **be transparent about every step in your workflow**.

# Towards open data science (cont.)

.pull-left[
## Good practice

- Pre-register designs `osf.io`, `aspredicted.org` 
- Do version control `GitHub`
- Publish all research outputs (and inputs if possible) `GitHub`, `plain-text formats`
- Disclose and document software pipeline `targets`, `make`
- Make analysis reproducible `renv`, `Docker`
- Make preprints accessible `arXiv`, `osf.io`
- Public in open access journals
